# Xsync

## Bash 3.2+ Script
 XSYNC(3) bash sync manager using fswatch + rsync. Uses config file to spawn rsync tasks. Pretty janky but works.This repo 
is a temporary home until I move into its final @basfx/fx-xsync home because I was not saving changes! oops.

## Note
 Please note that this is only been tested on latest mac os and may not work on other linux systems (atm) for things like sed that 
may have a different implementation. Note that this also requires fswatch (`brew install fswatch`).

 Please also note that the script will need some major cleanup so consider this a beta if you decide to use it.

## Install

First specify your `$XSYNC_HOME` prefix which will be the home directory for all files used by XSYNC. Add it to your .profile in 
or current environment.

XSYNC will look for your default config file in `$XSYNC_HOME/config`. You can also use the `--config` command to specify a path. 

Config file format is `SSH_HOST LOCAL_DIR HOST_DIR` one RSYNC entry per line. You can have multiples of the same host in case your 
syncing multiple directories. SSH_HOST is the host entry in your `~/.ssh/config` where you have already setup SSH keys on your local 
and remote server. 

XSYNC has not been tested to handle RSYNC ssh connections without a pre-made key.

Warning -- first make sure you have essential files backed before attempting to use xsync, and its best to test with a set of dummy 
directories to make sure everything is working ok before running live files. "Works on my machine"

## Usage

### xsync (command) [options]

### xsync help
*prints commands and options*

### xsync --trace 
*trace flag shows additional debug msgs level 2*
### xsync --debug
*debug flag prints non essential info level 1*
### xsync --quiet
*shuts off all non-essential outputs and only prints essentials*
### xsync --mirror
*enables deleted file sync on rsync, by default it only syncs writes*
### xsync --config path/to/config
*set a custom path for the config file that should be used*

### xsync run 
*iterates through the config file to start an fswatch and rsync handler for each entry*
### xsync stop
*kills all fswatch and child rsync processes, which just uses PID-1 to find the child*
### xsync pause <N>
*pause the FSWATCH JOB with index N*
### xsync restart <N>
*restart the FSWATCH JOB with index N*
### xsync now 
*list all watchers and their status*

*there are additional utility commands mostly for debugging, check the dispatch function to see all of them*

## Final Note

Now that I have the basics working it may be a minute before I get around to fully debugging/cleaning up but feel free to toy around 
and if you have any recommendations please let me know.
